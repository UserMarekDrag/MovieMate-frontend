# MovieMade
MovieMade is a web application for managing and organizing movie collections. The project is divided into separate repositories for the backend and frontend components, utilizing Python, Django, MySQL for the backend, and React for the frontend.

## Frontend Repository
The frontend repository contains the client-side code for the MovieMade application. It uses React to create an interactive user interface for managing movie collections.

### Prerequisites
Before running the frontend, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 14+)
- npm (version 7+)

### Installation
To install the frontend:

Clone the frontend repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the frontend directory.
Install the dependencies using npm install.
Start the development server using npm start.
The frontend application will now be running at http://localhost:3000/.
Usage
The frontend provides a user-friendly interface for managing movies and genres. Users can view, add, edit, and delete movies, as well as filter movies by genre. The frontend communicates with the backend API to perform these operations.

### API Endpoints
The backend provides the following API endpoints for the frontend to interact with:

- /api/movies: CRUD operations for managing movies.
- /api/users: CRUD operations for managing users.

Make sure to refer to the backend's API documentation for detailed information on each endpoint, including request and response formats.
