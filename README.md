# MovieMate Frontend

Welcome to MovieMate, the ultimate movie showtimes hub for cinema lovers in Poland. This frontend repository contains the user interface code written primarily in React.

## About

MovieMate offers a seamless user experience where users can select their city and date to view all available movie showtimes from major cinema chains in Poland, including Multikino and Helios. The frontend interacts with the backend service, which scrapes data daily from cinema websites to keep the information up-to-date and comprehensive.

## Features

- **Movie Showtimes**: Users can choose their city and date to view all movie showtimes from all cinemas in that city. The application offers detailed information about each showtime and includes links for additional details.

- **Reservations**: The application provides direct links for movie reservations, offering an effortless booking experience for the users.

## Prerequisites

Before running the frontend, ensure you have the following installed:
- Docker 
- docker-compose

## Installation

To get the frontend running on your local machine:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the repository.
3. Build the Docker image and start the containers using `docker-compose up --build`.
4. The frontend should now be accessible at http://localhost:3000/.

## Docker

We use Docker to simplify the development and deployment processes. All the necessary configurations are provided in the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml file in the repository.

## API Endpoints

This frontend service relies on the backend API to retrieve data. The main API endpoints are for fetching movie showtimes and user management. For detailed information about these endpoints, including request and response formats, refer to the backend API documentation.

## Deployment

The code of the frontend application is stored in an AWS S3 bucket. The frontend of MovieMate is hosted on AWS CloudFront and is accessible via https://d3jxswvg482l9t.cloudfront.net/. It uses an SSL certificate for secure connections.

The deployment process is automated using AWS CloudPipeline. Any changes pushed to the main branch are automatically retrieved by CloudPipeline, built using CodeBuild, and then the current application on CloudFront is replaced with the new version. This ensures that the live application is always up-to-date with the latest changes.

The frontend is configured to interact seamlessly with the backend, ensuring a smooth user experience.


## Backend Repository

The backend repository contains the server-side code for the MovieMade application. It uses Python and Django to handle API requests and communicate with the PostgreSQL database.

For instructions on setting up and running the backend, please refer to the [MovieMate-backend repository](https://github.com/UserMarekDrag/MovieMate-backend).
